## Tips for Best Results

### Choosing a Goal Image

✅ **Good Choices**:
- High contrast images
- Clear subjects
- Bold colors
- Simple compositions
- Faces with distinct features
- Logos with clear shapes

❌ **Avoid**:
- Very low resolution
- Extremely busy/detailed scenes
- Very similar tones throughout
- All white or all black images

### Choosing Tile Photos

✅ **Good Choices**:
- Varied colors (cover the spectrum)
- Different brightness levels
- Mix of warm and cool tones
- Interesting textures
- At least 500x500px resolution

❌ **Avoid**:
- All similar colors
- All the same brightness
- Too small (under 300x300px)
- Extremely detailed/busy (tiles are small)

**Pro Tip**: Use 3-5 tiles with complementary colors for best color matching.

### Tile Size Guidelines

| Goal | Tile Size | Trade-off |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Maximum Detail | 8-12px | Longer processing, more tiles visible |
| Balanced | 16-20px | Good detail, fast processing |
| Artistic/Painterly | 24-32px | Fast, bold blocks, artistic feel |
| Quick Preview | 48-64px | Very fast, abstract feel |

**Rule of Thumb**: Divide your output width by tile size to get tile count:
- 1200px ÷ 16px = 75 tiles wide
- Aim for 50-100 tiles per dimension for good balance

### Tint Overlay Guidelines

| Goal | Tint Opacity | Effect |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Pure Tile Art | 0% | See actual tiles, no color matching |
| Light Touch | 10-20% | Subtle color adjustment |
| Balanced | 25-35% | Good color match, tiles visible |
| Strong Match | 40-50% | Close to original, tiles less visible |
| Maximum Accuracy | 55-60% | Very close to original, artistic effect lost |

**Recommendation**: Start at 30% and adjust based on your tile photos.

### Animation Settings

#### GIF Width Trade-offs

| Width | File Size | Quality | Best For |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 400px | Small (1-3MB) | Good | Social media, quick previews |
| 600px | Medium (2-6MB) | Excellent | General sharing, presentations |
| 800px | Large (4-10MB) | Exceptional | High-quality displays, portfolios |

#### Duration & FPS Combinations

**Fast Reveal** (2-3 seconds):
- FPS 20-25: Smooth, professional
- Good for: Social media, attention-grabbing

**Standard** (4-5 seconds):
- FPS 20: Good balance
- Good for: Most use cases, presentations

**Slow Reveal** (6-8 seconds):
- FPS 15-20: Cinematic
- Good for: Artistic pieces, detailed mosaics

#### Start Zoom Guidelines

The start zoom determines how close you begin:

| Zoom | View | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| 6-8x | Show ~10 tiles | Wide context, less detail |
| 10-12x | Show 4-6 tiles | Balanced start |
| 15-18x | Show 2-3 tiles | Clear tile detail |
| 20x | Show 1-2 tiles | Maximum detail reveal |

**Important**: Higher zoom works best with smaller tile sizes. With 32px tiles and 20x zoom, you might only see partial tiles.

### Focus Point Strategy

The focus point is where the animation starts. Choose wisely:

**For Portraits**:
- Click on the eyes (most interesting)
- Or the face center
- Avoid edge areas

**For Landscapes**:
- Click on the focal point (mountain peak, sunset, etc.)
- Avoid sky-only or empty areas

**For Logos**:
- Click on the most recognizable part
- Usually the center works well

**For Abstract**:
- Click on the most detailed/interesting area
- Or use center (default)

## Troubleshooting Results

### "My mosaic looks too uniform/boring"

**Solutions**:
- Use more varied tile photos (different colors)
- Reduce tint overlay to see tiles more
- Try smaller tile size for more variety
- Pick goal image with more color variation

### "Colors don't match at all"

**Solutions**:
- Increase tint overlay to 40-50%
- Use tile photos that cover more of the color spectrum
- Ensure tiles aren't all the same brightness

### "Animation doesn't show tile detail"

**Solutions**:
- Increase start zoom (try 18-20x)
- Use smaller tile size (8-12px)
- Make sure focus point is on interesting area
- Increase GIF width to 800px

### "GIF file is too large"

**Solutions**:
- Reduce GIF width to 400px
- Lower FPS to 10-15
- Shorten duration to 2-3s
- These can reduce file size by 50-75%

### "Animation is choppy"

**Solutions**:
- Increase FPS to 25-30
- Use ease out cubic (smoothest)
- Ensure duration is at least 3s
- Check if browser is throttling (close other tabs)

## Advanced Tips

### Creating Themed Mosaics

**Holiday Theme**: Use seasonal photos as tiles
**Brand Identity**: Use brand colors in tile photos
**Monochrome**: Use black and white tile photos only
**Gradient**: Use tiles that progress from light to dark

### Optimal File Sizes

Target file sizes for different platforms:

- **Twitter**: <5MB (use 400-600px, 15fps, 3-4s)
- **Instagram**: <8MB (use 600px, 20fps, 4-5s)
- **Email**: <3MB (use 400px, 10fps, 2-3s)
- **Website**: <10MB (use 600-800px, 20fps, 4-6s)

### Batch Creating Variations

Same goal image, different effects:
1. Generate with 8px tiles, 20% tint → "Detailed"
2. Generate with 32px tiles, 50% tint → "Painterly"
3. Generate with 16px tiles, 35% tint → "Balanced"

Compare and pick your favorite!

### Storytelling with Mosaics

Use tile photos that relate to the goal image:
- **Travel photo**: Use tiles from that location
- **Event photo**: Use tiles from the same event
- **Portrait**: Use tiles of things the person loves
